How to run:

    1. Open the 'Final Project' directory in any Java interpreter.

    2. Add all '.in' files that you wish to evaluate to the 'Final Project > inputs' directory.

    3. Run the main(...) method in the Main class in 'Final Project > src'.

    4. All the relevant output files will appear in the 'Final Project > outputs' directory
        when the program has finished.

* Only the classes Cache, Edge, Graph, GraphBuilder, HeuristicNetworkBuilder, Main, Network2, and Vertex
    are actually relevant to the final product---GraphGenerator was used to generate the inputs I turned
    in in Phase 1, and the other classes were part of a first attempt that has since been abandoned.

* The directory 'Final Project > testing_files' exists for convenience in case you wish to store any files
    somewhere that's not the 'inputs' or 'outputs' directories.
